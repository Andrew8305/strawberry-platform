## Strawberry Real-Time Streaming Events Processing Platform ##
Strawberry is a platform that helps developers to easily write applications to processes streams of events coming in at a rapid pace, real time. The main objective of this platform is to keep the developer's focus out of plumbing activities and only make them focus on their business logic. 
In a typical Big Data world of events processing, there are quite a lot of challenges. A few main ones (in the context of what Strawberry solves), are listed here.

 - Choosing the right technology stack.
 - Horizontal scalability.
 - Ability to scale fast based on business needs.
 - Cloud friendly design.
 - Enabling a lot of business opportunities outside the platform (eg: Machine Learning, Analytics etc).
 - Operational tools to monitor the platform (Throughput, Performance etc).
 - Easy to add support for more events in the future.
 - Developer Productivity.
 
 ### Principles ###
 - Developer Productivity - Strawberry platform provides a solid foundation built using the right technology stack for processing large volumes of real-time streaming events. Typically, in an event processing application a lot of plumbing activities are required even to write a simple "Hello World" app. Strawberry relieves all the pain by giving the developers a solid platform to only write their business logic and all the rest is taken care of.
- Scaleable Design - Strawberry is built using Microservices Architecture which is a modern architecture for large scale cloud friendly apps. The principle of microservices is much like the unix philosophy - "Do one thing and do it well".
- Effective Utilisation of Resources - Strawberry is built for utilizing all the available cores in the system effectively by applying modern reactive principles.
- Distributed/Fault Tolerant by Design - Strawberry uses Kafka, MongoDB, Elasticsearch which are built for distributed apps and have been put to production in a large number of enterprises. They have built in support for resiliency by employing replication.
- We haven't forgotten our Ops team - Strawberry offers straight out of the box dashboards that gives a lot of KPIs on systems performance and health.
-   Declarative syntax - Strawberry offers "JSON" as a format to define the event processing instruction. It is also possible for the app developers to write a custom java code with their business logic and allow it to be called by the platform. Employs the famous Hollywood principle - "Don't call us, We'll call you".
